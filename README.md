# CrushIt

**CrushIt** is an iOS app that helps **cigarette addicted people** in their dependency healing process. 

It helps users in three ways:
- Provides them with a plan based on the Transtheoretical Model of Change, developed by Prochaska and DiClemente in the late 1970s, which outlines 5 Stages of Change 
- Keeps track of their **progress** by allowing the users to input information about each day, which they then can revisit in the future
- Provides a graphical representation of the state they are at
